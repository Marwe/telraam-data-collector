      summary: Instances
      description: >
        This method can be used to retrieve all available public camera instances from the server. An instance is defined by the mac_id of the connected Telraam device, the user_id of its owner, the segment_id of its location, and its direction relative to the road segment (this translates to the left or right side of the road). If any of these parameters changes - because for example the camera is being moved to another road segment -, then there will be a new instance created for this new situation, and the old instance will be closed by adding a time_end value to it. We have now too many instances for a direct download, so the initial request will result in a status_code 201 and a download_url - the full dataset can be accessed via that link.

      description: >
        This method can be used to retrieve all Telraam segments with their segment identifier and geographical data (EPSG:4326) that are inside a specific area/polygon. For the "area" options only segments are included that have produced some data in the past (this filtering is not possible for the "polygon" option). Under the schemes three different usage options are available. If you want segments that have their centroid within a circle with a radious of R kilometers around a geographical coordinate, then use "area":"lon[degrees],lat[degrees],radius[km]", e.g. "4.44,51.19,1" is segments within a 1 km radious circle around 4.44 East and 51.19 North. If you want segments that fall within (any part of the segment, here we don't look at the centroid) an area specified by the diagonal coordinates of a bounding box (upper left and bottom right, or bottom left and upper right), then use "area":"lon_ul,lat_ul,lon_br_lat_br", all given in degrees just like in the circle option. The "polygon" option is shown below.

        This call returns a GeoJSON entity with the geometry of the segments as a MultiLineString (actually a single line string containing the coordinate pars that define the segment) and a limited set of properties (main category counts, v85 when contents are "full", and segment geometry information) for all active segments for a given (UTC) hour. Using this method you can get all information necessary to make a Telraam map.

        This call returns a GeoJSON entity with the geometry of the segments as a MultiLineString (actually a single line string containing the coordinate pars that define the segment) and a limited set of properties (main category counts, v85, and segment geometry information) for all active segments at the present time. Using this method you can get all information necessary to make a live Telraam map. The results will contain the most recent count data for each segment if it is not older than 2 hours, plus extra information about segments that have been registered within the last week but are not live yet, plus about segments that were live at one point over the past 7 days but are currently offline. De-registered segments are not included. So if there is no last_data_package entry (and object counts of course) in the response for a given segment, then it is a recently registered not yet active segment, and if there is no date (and object counts of course) then it is a segment that is currently offline (and the last_data_package will show since when).

        Can be used to retrieve detailed observed traffic statistics for selected segments, instances, or devices for a given time interval (maximum interval for a single call depends on the number of requested identifiers and columns). When multiple IDs are in the request, data for each ID are returned separately (so counts are not aggregated or averaged over the identifiers for the same time epoch). Parameters for the API call can be provided in the body portion of the call. The example response contains the results for a single identifier (in case of multiple identifiers the same structure is repeated for each ID).

Using the devices level provides a slightly faster access to the latest available measurement of active devices (as it bypasses scheduled data-processing services).

        Can be used to retrieve traffic totals along with some other useful metrics for segments, instances, or devices for a given time interval. Parameters for the API call can be provided in the body portion of the call. Note: statistics are always calculated based on hourly data (and not quarterly), so the minimum resolution of the call is one hour. The API call returns statistics for each requested ID separately (so totals for each ID instead of a single total across all IDs), but in the response example below only a single ID's contents are shown.

For Telraam V1 devices typically under 0.8, while for Telraam S2 devices usually near 1. Does not take into account 0 uptime hours (so hours where a Telraam was not active). Uptime 1 only means that in the hours of activity over the requested interval the device/instance/segment was 100% active. It does not mean that all hours of the requested interval were observed - for this see the coverage parameter.

It is calculated as the samplesize divided by the number of hours in the requested time interval. To understand the difference between coverage and uptime, take the following example. E.g., an S2 device was working perfectly - uptime 1.0 - but only on 50% of the days in the requested period. Then the coverage will be 0.5. Or take a V1 device which had an uptime of 0.59 in the daylight hours, but only 15 of the 24 hours had enough light to collect data, so the coverage of the data over the requested period is 15/24 = 0.625. And only in that covered period is the uptime calculated (so uptime does not take into account 0 uptime hours).

      summary: Live quarterly traffic snapshot [Advanced API]
      description: >
        This call returns a GeoJSON entity with the geometry of the segments as a MultiLineString (actually a single line string containing the coordinate pars that define the segment) and a limited set of properties (main category counts, v85, and segment geometry information) for all active segments at the present time. Using this method you can get all information necessary to make a live Telraam map. The results will contain the most recent quarterly count data for each segment if it is not older than 45 minutes, plus extra information about segments that have been registered within the last week but are not live yet, plus about segments that were live at one point over the past 7 days but are currently offline. De-registered segments are not included. So if there is no last_data_package entry (and object counts of course) in the response for a given segment, then it is a recently registered not yet active segment, and if there is no date (and object counts of course) then it is a segment that is currently offline (and the last_data_package will show since when).

      summary: Typical traffic [Advanced API]
      description: >
        Can be used to retrieve the typical traffic of a given segment or instance (or segments/instances). Typical traffic is the foundation of many of the analytical tools and data products that we offer to our Data subscribers. As an example, typical data includes the typical (average) counts (and the most likely range) for the expected car traffic for a Monday morning between 08:00 and 08:15 based on the last 12 months' actual traffic - but it is available for all modes, days of the week, time of day, and over various baseline periods. Note: typical traffic is calculated in local time, unlike the traffic counts returned by other APIs, which are in UTC. We provide typical traffic volumes calculated as the average (and standard deviation) of historical traffic counts over the periods of a year, a season, and a month leading up to the date of the calculation (referred to as the epoch). Each typical product is calculated at regular intervals to provide a continuously growing set of historical averages corresponding to various epochs. The data is made available on a quarterly and hourly resolution, for each mode, down to each day of the week (including a more general weekday and weekend option too for the monthly baseline option that has too few days for a more fine-grained day of the week resolution). The oldest epoch for this service is the 24th of May, 2023 (or later, depending on the selected segment). The Telraam S2 specific 10 modes and the night mode are available starting from the 12th of July 2024. NOTE: from this date averages are calculated excluding zero values! Starting from epochs at the end of February 2025 instance level data is also available.

                    - 'year'

                  description: When it is true, the API will return only the most recent typical traffic with calculation time (or more precisely, duration period end time, or simply epoch) inside the [time_start,time_end) interval. If it is false, it will return all typical traffic entries (with end_times inside the interval) from the interval. Since we wil be calculating typical at least traffic every two weeks, if your interval is 1 year, then you can get up to 24 (or more) historical typical traffic entries (e.g. 24 monthly entries calculated half a month apart).
                  enum:
                    - true

                  description: The beginning of the requested time interval (UTC). This interval relates to the end_time (a.k.a. the epoch) property of a given typical calculation (in UTC). The end_time (or epoch) of a typical calculation is the date where the duration of the typical interval terminates. So if a given typical traffic is calculated from data from 20220101 to 20221231, then end_time of this typical is 20221231, so the time_start and time_end interval of the API needs to include this date for the typical in question to be returned. This parameter is also returned by the API.
                time_end:
                  type: string
                  description: The end of the requested time interval (UTC, the time interval is closed-open, so the end time is not included anymore in the request). See notes on the time_start property for more information.

                  description: Optional. A list of requested columns. Default - when columns are not specified - is all columns, but this is not recommended (except when using the latest_only = true option), as it could lead to an easier timeout of the API call. We included an example use case with some commonly used variables below. Do not exclude segment_id, instance_id, duration, interval, day_of_week, time, time_start, time_end from the call, because these are needed for the API to work properly. When not using the latest_only = true option, it is strongly recommended to limit the requested variables to the minimum in order to avoid size limits for the returned data, by only adding one or two extra parameters, e.g., avg_car to the not to be excluded variables mentioned earlier. You might need to balance the requested time interval and number of columns, and/or limit yourself to hourly data for longer request intervals/more columns. A list of all possible columns is segment_id, instance_id, duration, interval, day_of_week, time, time_start, time_end, flag, avg_heavy, std_heavy, avg_car, std_car, avg_bike, std_bike, avg_pedestrian, std_pedestrian, avg_heavy_lft, std_heavy_lft, avg_heavy_rgt, std_heavy_rgt, avg_car_lft, std_car_lft, avg_car_rgt, std_car_rgt, avg_bike_lft, std_bike_lft, avg_bike_rgt, std_bike_rgt, avg_pedestrian_lft, std_pedestrian_lft, avg_pedestrian_rgt, std_pedestrian_rgt, avg_mode_bicycle_lft, std_mode_bicycle_lft, avg_mode_bicycle_rgt, std_mode_bicycle_rgt, avg_mode_bus_lft, std_mode_bus_lft, avg_mode_bus_rgt, std_mode_bus_rgt, avg_mode_car_lft, std_mode_car_lft, avg_mode_car_rgt, std_mode_car_rgt, avg_mode_lighttruck_lft, std_mode_lighttruck_lft, avg_mode_lighttruck_rgt, std_mode_lighttruck_rgt, avg_mode_motorcycle_lft, std_mode_motorcycle_lft, avg_mode_motorcycle_rgt, std_mode_motorcycle_rgt, avg_mode_pedestrian_lft, std_mode_pedestrian_lft, avg_mode_pedestrian_rgt, std_mode_pedestrian_rgt, avg_mode_stroller_lft, std_mode_stroller_lft, avg_mode_stroller_rgt, std_mode_stroller_rgt, avg_mode_tractor_lft, std_mode_tractor_lft, avg_mode_tractor_rgt, std_mode_tractor_rgt, avg_mode_trailer_lft, std_mode_trailer_lft, avg_mode_trailer_rgt, std_mode_trailer_rgt, avg_mode_truck_lft, std_mode_truck_lft, avg_mode_truck_rgt, std_mode_truck_rgt, avg_uptime, std_uptime, samplesize, avg_car_speed_hist_0to70plus, std_car_speed_hist_0to70plus, avg_car_speed_hist_0to120plus, std_car_speed_hist_0to120plus, avg_v85, std_v85, avg_mode_night_lft, std_mode_night_lft, avg_mode_night_rgt, std_mode_night_rgt, avg_mode_night, std_mode_night.

        Can be used to retrieve the hourly v85 speed histogram (similar to the ones shown on the segment pages of the Telraam website), along with the corresponding speed distributions in hour-of-the-day bins for a given time interval. In a bit more detail, the API call returns the speed histograms known (as car_speed_hist_0to120plus) from the Traffic API but summed up over each hour of the day (in the local time of the segment/instance) over the requested time interval (and without normalisation, thus including raw count data), along with the v85 speed calculated from each hourly histogram. The response example below shows only a single hour's contents for brevity.

      description: >
        Can be used to retrieve a range of general statistics, performance indicators, ready-to-plot data, and trends for the selected month (and the month preceding that as a baseline for comparison for some of the parameters). Time data is in local time of the requested segment (or segment corresponding to the selected instance), and averages are uptime weighted (as usual for Telraam). Be careful when interpreting specific variables, as the ratio of daytime/night time hours and changes in device uptime will be a definite source of bias! (Note: the example value for the quality_chart variable is truncated for brevity, see Response Schema for more details.)
